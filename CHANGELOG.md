## 0.0.0-1 Jun 22, 2022

**Experimental** This is the first release of the Deno interfaces, as such it still needs a lot of testing and comes with no guarantee that it actually does what it says on the tin. Being brand new and not completely tested on end-to-end operation, unfound dragons probably do remain even with very basic operations. If you do try it out, let us know.
